advanced:
    ##Enable this option if you want to have a fixed width of all your camera streams, 
    ##By default rpisurv autocalculates this value, this can cause streams to get "stretched", 
    ##if this value exceeds the available height, rpisurv will fallback to autocalculation   
    #fixed_width: 500
